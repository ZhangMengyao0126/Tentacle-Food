## Field & Property
### Field
1. A variable that is declared directly in a class or struct. It holds data.<br>
2. Fields allow you to access their values directly when they're public.<br>
### Property
1. A special kind of class member that provides controlled access to the data (often stored in a private field).<br>
2. Properties allow you to include logic in their get and set accessors, which can manage several behaviors you want to implement when accessing or modifying the data.<br>
